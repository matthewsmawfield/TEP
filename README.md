## Abstract

Einstein taught us two unforgettable lessons: simultaneity is relative and spacetime geometry is dynamical. Here we argue for an equally consequential third: the rate at which time flows is itself a dynamical field. We elevate proper time to the output of a universal matter metric ĝμν related to the gravitational metric gμν by a controlled conformal–disformal relation, ĝμν = A(φ)² gμν + B(φ) ∇μφ ∇νφ, where φ is a scalar "time field." This Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP)—universal coupling of non-gravitational physics to ĝμν—preserves local Lorentz invariance and the local value of c while turning global one-way measurements of light, clock synchronization, and temporal transport into probes of the time field.

We resolve long-standing confusions about "variable c" by replacing convention-dependent statements with invariant observables tied to measurement procedures. We define a synchronization one-form σ̃ on spacelike slices of the matter metric and show that its curl dσ̃, after subtraction of general-relativistic (GR) Sagnac/gravito-magnetic terms, yields a residual "temporal holonomy" H that vanishes in GR and becomes nonzero only when time is dynamical in our sense. We prove two key theorems: (i) conformal matter coupling preserves null cones, so photons and gravitons share the same causal structure at late times; (ii) a static φ-gradient generates no first-order one-way light-time anisotropy, placing effects in the femto-to-picosecond regime over astronomical baselines under current bounds. Disformal tilts (B ≠ 0) are tightly constrained by GW170817-class multi-messenger observations but can source holonomy at levels within reach of next-generation metrology.

We present a covariant action, derive field equations, conservation, and invertibility/causality conditions, and supply a 3+1 decomposition that makes observables explicit. Screening via a density-dependent effective potential reconciles precision local tests with cosmological evolution, and we map to Parametrized Post-Newtonian parameters and to the EFT-of-dark-energy α-functions with cT = 1 enforced. We outline decisive experiments with quantitative error budgets: (1) a ground–ground–satellite triangle time-transfer experiment targeting holonomy at below 10⁻¹⁸ fractional after GR subtraction; (2) portable-clock "clock anholonomy" around closed paths at the 10⁻¹⁹ level over days; (3) multi-species clock networks seeking phase-locked annual modulations at 10⁻¹⁹–10⁻¹⁷; (4) interplanetary one-way optical links at picoseconds over AU; (5) altitude-dependent screening maps with optical clocks and atom interferometers; and (6) ensemble multi-messenger tests. We provide a cosmological pipeline plan for CLASS/HyRec modifications and MCMC inference, and we commit to open data and blinded analyses.

Einstein's postulate of universal c was a brilliant, operationally perfect approximation in regimes where time's flow is effectively uniform. In a universe where the rate of time is dynamical yet locally Lorentzian, "the speed of light" emerges as an invariant in every local lab but ceases to be globally universal. The new invariant content resides in path-dependent synchronization defects and holonomies of time transport, not in naive one-way "speeds." If detected, these invariants would inaugurate a post-Einsteinian era: from dynamic geometry to dynamic time.
