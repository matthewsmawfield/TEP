## Abstract

We propose a covariant, testable reformulation of relativity in which proper time is a dynamical field and the "speed of light" is an emergent, strictly local invariant rather than a global constant. The framework is built on a single spacetime manifold endowed with two metrics: a gravitational metric g<sub>μν</sub> and a causal (matter) metric g̃<sub>μν</sub> to which all non-gravitational fields and clocks couple. The metrics are related by a controlled disformal map, g̃<sub>μν</sub> = A(φ) g<sub>μν</sub> + B(φ) ∇<sub>μ</sub>φ ∇<sub>ν</sub>φ, where φ is the time field, A(φ) = exp(2β φ/M<sub>Pl</sub>) is a universal conformal factor, and B(φ) encodes tiny, direction-dependent deformations of the light cone consistent with multi-messenger constraints (|c<sub>γ</sub> − c<sub>g</sub>|/c ≲ 10<sup>-15</sup> today). We elevate proper time to a field by postulating that all matter, electromagnetism, and quantum phases evolve with respect to g̃-proper time τ; in local freely falling frames, this guarantees exact local Lorentz invariance and a locally invariant c, while globally it implies that synchronization procedures and one-way light-time measurements become path-dependent in a dynamical-time background. We develop the full action, field equations, conservation laws, Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) mapping, and screening mechanisms that reconcile terrestrial tests with cosmological dynamics. We formalize the breakdown of global simultaneity using a synchronization-transport law and derive a convention-independent "synchronization holonomy," an invariant measure of non-integrability of time transport around closed loops. In purely conformal theories this holonomy vanishes once general-relativistic Sagnac and Shapiro terms are removed; a nonzero holonomy at leading order requires non-exact structure provided either by (i) disformal photon coupling B(φ) ≠ 0 or (ii) more general non-metricity. We provide explicit small-B formulas for the holonomy and the effective photon phase speed.d one-way asymmetry is related to φ-gradients and disformal scales under current constraints. We demonstrate that Einstein's assumption of a universal c was a brilliant local theorem arising from the Temporal Equivalence Principle; transcending it demands dynamical time: c remains exactly invariant locally, but global, one-way-inferred "c" values differ by path-dependent amounts that our experiments can detect or bound. We outline a decisive, near-term experimental program: (1) a closed-loop, multi-leg, one-way time-transfer "triangle test" designed to detect synchronization holonomy at the 10^{-19}–10^{-20} fractional level after subtracting known GR effects; (2) interplanetary one-way optical time transfer targeting picosecond-level asymmetries over AU baselines; (3) altitude- and environment-dependent screening maps with modern optical clock arrays; (4) multi-messenger searches for distance-correlated photon–gravitational-wave arrival differentials consistent with tightly bounded disformal propagation; (5) matter-wave interferometry and torsion-balance tests sensitive to environment-dependent couplings. Cosmologically, the time field can shift the sound horizon and late-time expansion, potentially easing H_0 and S_8 tensions while preserving Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and CMB acoustic physics. We address known weaknesses in the variable-c literature by supplying a correct, operationally invariant observable (holonomy), clarifying when conformal couplings cannot produce a signal, and providing realistic, constraint-consistent signal forecasts with explicit error budgets and statistical plans (pre-registration, blinding, publicly released code and data). The resulting theory preserves the empirical pillars of relativity (local Lorentz invariance, gravitational-wave causality, PPN bounds) while extending its conceptual foundation: simultaneity is not only relative but generally non-integrable; the speed of light is not a global constant but the local echo of a deeper, dynamical temporal geometry.

We resolve long-standing confusions about "variable c" by replacing convention-dependent statements with invariant observables tied to measurement procedures. We define a synchronization one-form σ̃ on spacelike slices of the matter metric and show that its curl dσ̃, after subtraction of general-relativistic (GR) Sagnac/gravito-magnetic terms, yields a residual "temporal holonomy" H that vanishes in GR and becomes nonzero only when time is dynamical in our sense. We prove two key theorems: (i) conformal matter coupling preserves null cones, so photons and gravitons share the same causal structure at late times; (ii) a static φ-gradient generates no first-order one-way light-time anisotropy, placing effects in the femto-to-picosecond regime over astronomical baselines under current bounds. Disformal tilts (B ≠ 0) are tightly constrained by GW170817-class multi-messenger observations but can source holonomy at levels within reach of next-generation metrology. We present a covariant action, derive field equations, conservation, and invertibility/causality conditions, and supply a 3+1 decomposition that makes observables explicit. Screening via a density-dependent effective potential reconciles precision local tests with cosmological dynamics; a controlled disformal sector allows minute, bounded photon-cone tilts that provide clean targets for holonomy experiments. The theory is falsifiable with realistic experiments and promises to clarify persistent cosmological tensions.

Einstein moved us from absolute time to relative simultaneity and dynamic geometry. The next step is to recognize that the flow of time itself is dynamical, and that "the speed of light" is the local echo of a deeper temporal geometry. If the predicted holonomies are observed, physics will enter a new epoch in which dynamic time joins dynamic geometry as a foundation. If not, we will have set uniquely strong bounds and clarified the operational bedrock of c and simultaneity to unprecedented precision.
